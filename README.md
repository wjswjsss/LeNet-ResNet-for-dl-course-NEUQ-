# üß† CIFAR-10 Classification with LeNet-5 and ResBlock Enhanced LeNet 
### (HW for DL course @ NEUQ - by Chiashu Wang ÁéãÂÆ∂Êæç)

This is the FIRST homework of Deep Learning course @ NEUQ (Northeastern University of Qinhuangdao)

The project implements and compares two convolutional neural network architectures on the CIFAR-10 dataset:

- **LeNet-5** (adapted for RGB images)
- **LeNet-5 with Residual Blocks (ResBlock)**

About the architectures, plz go see the comment section in "./models/resblock.py", "./models/lenet_cifar10.py",
"./models/reslenet.py"

The models are trained and evaluated using PyTorch, with performance metrics plotted for comparison.

## ‚ö° Quick Start 

This project is tested and runs smoothly in the [**d2l-zh**](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-zh) environment.

Once you're inside the **d2l-zh** environment, simply run:

```bash
python main.py
```
This will start the training of the two independent neural networks.

Output will be two **.pth** files for the *best epoch weights* of the two & *a line chart* showing how the metrics about 
the two models change after epoches.
