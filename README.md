# 🧠 CIFAR-10 Classification with LeNet-5 and ResBlock Enhanced LeNet 
### (HW for DL course @ NEUQ - by Chiashu Wang 王JIA澍)

This is the FIRST homework of Deep Learning course @ NEUQ (Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao)

The project implements and compares two convolutional neural network architectures on the CIFAR-10 dataset:

- **LeNet-5** (adapted for RGB images)
- **LeNet-5 with Residual Blocks (ResBlock)**

See the architectures of the models in the [Implementation Details](#implementation-details) section.

The models are trained and evaluated using PyTorch, with performance metrics plotted for comparison.

## ⚡ Quick Start 

To run this program, first (highly recommended)

```bash
conda create -n dlCourseNEUQ python=3.10
conda activate dlCourseNEUQ
```

to create a new virtual environment.

Then install the dependencies, 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once everything is ready, run

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start the training of the two independent neural networks.

Output will be two **.pth** files of the *best epoch weights* for both models, two **.csv** file containing the *metrics* and *a line chart* showing how the metrics change over epoches.

## Implementation Details

The LeNet architecture follows the original design proposed by LeCun et al. ([paper link](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf)).

The enhanced version, referred to as *LeNet with ResBlocks*, builds upon the original LeNet architecture by incorporating a total of four Residual Blocks—two after each convolutional layer.

### Modified LeNet with ResBlocks (Layer-wise)

1. Conv1 → BN → ReLU → ResBlock → ResBlock → Pool1  
2. Conv2 → BN → ReLU → ResBlock → ResBlock → Pool2    
3. FC1 → ReLU → FC2 → ReLU → FC3

## 🖥️ Runtime Environment

The project was tested on the following devices:

| Computational Resources | Remark           |
|-------------------------|------------------|
| NVIDIA RTX 3090         | Training          |
| Apple M1                | Local debugging   |

> *Note: The Apple M1 can also train this model, but VERY slow tho.*
